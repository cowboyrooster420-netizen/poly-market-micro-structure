# Production-Grade Implementation Roadmap

**Goal**: Take bot from 30% â†’ 90%+ potential utilization
**Approach**: Production-grade code with comprehensive testing for every feature
**Timeline**: Phased implementation, ~8-10 weeks total

---

## PHASE 1: FIX BROKEN CORE FEATURES (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Get existing high-value features actually working

### Task 1.1: Implement Real Cross-Market Leak Detection
**Status**: ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Currently disabled with fake data
**Location**: `src/bot/EarlyBot.ts:423`
**Current**: `detectCrossMarketLeaks()` generates random price changes (-5% to +5%)
**Impact**: 8/10 - Highest alpha signal type

**Implementation Plan**:
```
1. Create PriceHistoryTracker service
   - Store 24-hour rolling price history per market
   - Circular buffer: last 1000 prices at 30s intervals = 8.3 hours
   - Memory efficient: Map<marketId, RingBuffer<PricePoint>>

2. Calculate real correlations
   - Rolling Pearson correlation between related markets
   - Window: 1-hour, 4-hour, 8-hour timeframes
   - Detect correlation spikes (>0.7 when baseline <0.3)

3. Detect coordinated movements
   - Multiple markets in same category moving together
   - Volume surge + price correlation = stronger signal
   - Time the leak: when did abnormal correlation start?

4. Signal generation
   - Correlation spike + volume increase = cross_market_leak signal
   - Calculate: lead time, correlation strength, number of affected markets
   - Priority: HIGH if 3+ markets, MEDIUM if 2 markets
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] `src/services/PriceHistoryTracker.ts` - Track historical prices
- [ ] `src/services/CrossMarketCorrelationDetector.ts` - Calculate correlations
- [ ] Update `EarlyBot.ts:detectCrossMarketLeaks()` - Use real data
